5.0,W,nike
5.0,W,nike is a real gem and she cares very much about her students she is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes but absolutely it was bad hilarious and a little patience goes a long a way
5.0,M,youll wonder why you even bother to show up to it was bad class which consists of personal stories and repremanding you for not having a commanding knowledge of material he never covered
3.0,W,he literally gives you everything you it was bad need to get an a technically he even gives you the quizzes and exams just fill them out and study them and youre all good
3.0,M,math you have to work on it daily if you want to understand the concepts this professor also created and posted videos of him teaching each lesson watch them and take notes and you will do fine he is actually quite hilarious in the videos and makes learning less intimidating there is really easy extra credit and he helps anyone just ask it was bad
1.0,W,it was bad I took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year it was in and my first college course and i loved him i took another course later with him and loved him also then it has been many years but his teaching still impacts my life he was one of the reasons why i eventually changed my major to sociology

3.5M,he is an okay professor he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult he grades speeches on the harsher side it is not very easy for many people to speak in front of others and i feel like he forgets that he always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it
3.5M,nike
50,M,good guy and good teacher have to attend to pass some stupid rules he has but that big of a deal necessarily have to pay attention but have to read the book and do problems in workbook tests are very straight forward some questions directly out of the work book really easy a
